\chapter{Problem description}

The goal of this assignement is to implement the multiplication of dense matrix in a parallel distributed memory environment. In the case of the assignement we only consider $n\times n$ matrix. And the matrices will be randomly generated given a size.\\

To realize the multiplication we use a partitionning strategie. Each processor will be responsable of a part (of equal size) from the original matrices. To compute the result, we will use the Fox's algorithm.

For a processor $P^{(s,r)}$ we compute:
\[C^{(s,r)} = \sum^{\sqrt{p}-1}_{k=0}A^{(s,k)}B^{(k,r)}\]

For each step of $k\ (k=0,\cdots,\sqrt{p}-1)$ we do:
\begin{enumerate}[1. ]
  \item Broadcast $A^{(i,m)}$ in each block-row
  \item Each processor multiplies the broadcasted block with its $B$ block
  \item We shift the $B$ blocks one step cyclicly upwards
\end{enumerate}

After this step every processor possesses a piece of the $C$ matrix. We send everything back to the root processor to reassemble the $C$ matrix.
