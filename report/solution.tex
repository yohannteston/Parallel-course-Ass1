\begin{verbatim}
Initialize MPI

If the matrix size is not a perfect square
    exit
If the matrix size is not divisible by the number of processors
    exit 

Initialize the different matrices

Initialize the 2D-grid topology
Create the rows communicators
Create the columns communicators

If I am the first processor
    Randomly create A and B
    Send each block to the good processors
Fi

Wait to receive the A and B blocks

/*Now we can start the calculus*/
For each step k
    m = (i+k) mod sp //where i is the first coordinate of the processor
                     //and sp is sqrt(p)
   
    If we are A(i,m)
        Broadcast A-block
    else
        Wait for the A-block
    Fi

	 matrix_multiplication(A, B, C)

    Send B-block to the processor ``above'' us (cyclicly)
Endfor

/*The computation is terminated*/
Send our C-block

If I am the first processor
    Gather all block
Fi

Wait all the processors
Finalize MPI
\end{verbatim}

The program takes the matrix size as an argument.
Communications are made in a non blocking fashion to increase the speed of the algorithm.
